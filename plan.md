# Project Plan: Local Eats Guide

**Description:** A static website showcasing the best local restaurants in a specific area, complete with menus and reviews.

## Development Goals

- [ ] Create the basic HTML structure in index.html with a Tailwind CSS link, a header with navigation (Home, Restaurants, About), a main section, and a footer.
- [ ] Build out the hero section in index.html with a title, a search bar, and featured restaurant listings using placeholder images from placehold.co.
- [ ] Create the restaurants.html page, including a filter section (cuisine type, price range) and a grid of restaurant cards with images, descriptions, and links to individual restaurant pages (not implemented, but placeholder links).
- [ ] Design the about.html page, including information about the Local Eats Guide, the team behind it (with placeholder images), and a contact form (non-functional).
- [ ] Implement a responsive navigation bar using Tailwind CSS classes for different screen sizes in index.html, restaurants.html, and about.html.
- [ ] Add custom styles to assets/css/style.css to customize the color palette and typography of the website, focusing on restaurant-themed aesthetics.
- [ ] Add a footer to each page with copyright information and social media links (placeholder links).
